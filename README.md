# Welcome to the main repository for the fantasy football analyzed machine learning model group!

Key files in this repository include:

- `datapreprocess.ipynb`: This is where the data from fantasypros.com is scraped and cleaned.
- `LSTM.ipynb`: This is where the actual model is trained, and predictions are run.

Thanks and enjoy our work!
